# LearnKorean
Korean is one of the simplest languages in the world, yet it's also one of the most versatile.  
Nearly any sound can be expressed in Korean, despite (or perhaps due to) the incredibly pattern-based structure of a Korean word.  
Moreover, Korean influence has risen around the globe in the past decade, with the advent of K-Pop and manhwa.  
Then why is it that only around 1% of the world speaks Korean?  
## Mission Statement
LearnKorean aims to make learning Korean a simple endeavour - something you can do whenever you have free time, for as short (or long) as you want.  
## Structure
The base LearnKorean site is one static page. You scroll through lessons and stop wherever you want, then resume next time. There's no complicated page tree, no infinitely long URLs, just one long page.
