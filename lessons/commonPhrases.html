    <h2>Basic Phrases</h2>
    <hr>
    <b>안녕</b>
    <p>안녕 means <i>hello</i>!</p>
    <p>You say 안녕 when you're talking to friends or someone of similar equal standing - you don't say it to your grandparents or someone you respect.</p>
    <p>안녕 also means <i>goodbye</i>!</p>
    <p>In Korean, a lot of meaning comes from our tone of voice and content - it should be obvious whether you're saying hello or goodbye.</p>
    <p>Can you figure out how to pronounce 안녕?</p>
