    <h2>Pronounciation Generalized</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Now that we've gone over the basics, let's generalize pronounciation in Korean.</p>
    <p>There are 4 spots in Korean:</p>
    <table class="pronounciationChart">
        <tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">1</th>
              <td>2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">3</th>
              <td>4</td>
            </tr>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>There is <i>always</i> a sound in <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>There is <i>sometimes</i> a sound in <b>4</b>.</p>
    <p>There is <i>rarely</i> a sound in <b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at some examples:</p>
    <p>닭</p>
    <table class="pronounciationChart">
        <tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">ㄷ</th>
              <td>ㅏ</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">ㄹ</th>
              <td>ㄱ</td>
            </tr>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>This is pronounced not exactly as expected: ㄷ (d) + ㅏ (a) + ㄹ (l) + ㄱ (g).</p>
    <p>1 and 2 are normal: they make the "da" sound when combined.</p>
    <p>However, when there is a sound in 3, 3 and 4 combine slightly differently. Instead of just adding the two sounds, they sort of mush together.</p>
    <p>ㄹ + ㄱ doesn't make the "lg" sound, but rather a sharper "lk" sound (like talk).</p>
    <p>There isn't a particular pattern here - just try taking the two sounds and mashing them together.</p>
    <p>Here's another example:</p>
    <p>판</p>
    <p>You might wonder: if there's only one sound in the bottom, is that 3 or 4? From here on out, we'll call that sound 4, but in practice, there isn't really much of a difference.</p>
    <p>1 + 2 + 3 = ㅍ + ㅏ + ㄴ = p + aa + n.</p>
    <p>One more:</p>
    <p>자</p>
    <p>1 + 2 = ㅈ + ㅏ = j + aa.</p>
