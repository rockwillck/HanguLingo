    <h2>Special Pronounciations</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>There are a few things that don't follow the standard pronounciation rules.</p>
    <p>We'll go over 2 of the most common exceptions.</p>
    <h3>Stacks</h3>
    <p>옴</p>
    <p>You'll notice that this doesn't follow the 4-box rule. Instead, there's just three letters stacked. It's really simple to read this: just read from top to bottom.</p>
    <p>옴 = ㅇ + ㅗ + ㅁ = nothing + oh + m</p>
    <p>One thing to note here is that ㅇ still makes the "ng" sound when it's in the bottom, and no sound when it's in the top: this can be confusing since we haven't seen this format before.</p>

    <h3>Doubles</h3>
    <p>빠</p>
    <p>ㅃ isn't a letter we've seen before, but you might notice it just looks like two ㅂ's smushed together. That's because it is!</p>
    <p>There's 4 of these: ㅃ, ㅉ, ㄸ, and ㄲ.</p>
    <p>These don't really have a corresponding sound in English - instead, they're best described as just sharper versions of their single roots.</p>
    <p>For example, ㅃ is less like the b in "bear" but more like the b in the "bap"s you hear in older songs.</p>
