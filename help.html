        <p>Knowing Korean is beneficial for everyone, whether that's giving you a boost in your career options or letting you read manhwa in the language they were written in.</p>
        <p>Yet for non-native speakers, Korean can seem intimidating and unapprochable.</p>
        <p>The funny thing is, Korean is really, really simple.</p>
        <p>That's not hyperbole: Korean is one of the easiest languages to learn, especially compared to other Asian languages.</p>
        <p>LearnKorean aims to make learning Korean an endeavor that seems simple and easy, using our minimalist, from-beginner scrolling curriculum.</p>
